# Iosevka with ligatures from FiraCode
Adding programming ligatures to my favorite Iosevka.

## Why do I create it?
Although Iosevka has ligatures, but it's not work with my kitty terminal.
And FiraCode has some ligatures that I need.

## Which version of font that I use?
FiraCode v4 has infinite-length that I don't want to use and has some bugs on kitty (https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/1081).
So I will use FiraCode v3.1 for my font.
I will try to get some ligatures in higher version to my font in the future (TODO).

## Requirements
This script requires FontForge to build font. AFAIK, you can must `python-fontforge` (Debian/Ubuntu or ArchLinux) or `fontforge` (Gentoo, OpenSUSE).
